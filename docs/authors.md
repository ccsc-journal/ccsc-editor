# For Authors
Each regional conference’s "call for papers" has its own submission guidelines
for submitting work for consideration. Usually a PDF file with the authors'
information hidden is sufficient. You may choose to follow the final manuscript
formatting guidelines as follows so that minimal editing is needed when authors
need to submit their final manuscripts for publication.

# Final Manuscript
Once your work is accepted by the conference committee, you must prepare your
work for publication by following this guideline. We __strongly__ recommend
that you use our
[Latex templates](https://github.com/lubaochuan/ccsc-editor), which formats
your work using the specific style for our journal. It also makes our journal
editor's job easier because the final journal editing and compilation is done
in Latex.

The [Latex templates](https://github.com/lubaochuan/ccsc-editor) repository
contains further instructions in README files. You can download the repository
and choose the template you need. Each template has a sample pdf file showing
what the formatted work should look like.

If you do not want to use Latex we do accept final manuscripts in Word doc format.
Please use this [Word doc template](samples/sample-converted.docx),
which is converted from our Latex template. It has the correct margin size and
font size, which should help you gauge the length of your paper (number of pages).
Here is a list of sample publishable items:
- [speech abstract](samples/speech_abstract.pdf)
- [workshop abstract](samples/workshop_abstract.pdf)
- [tutorial abstract](samples/tutorial_abstract.pdf)
- [poster abstract](samples/poster_abstract.pdf)
- [panel abstract](samples/panel.pdf)
- [nifty assignment abstract](samples/nifty_assignment.pdf)
- [lightning talk abstract](samples/lightning_talk.pdf)
- [paper](samples/paper.pdf)

The following items should be included in your final manuscript submission:
- all source files (.tex, .bib, .doc, or .docx) and copies of
all images and figures in *separate* files.
- a PDF version of your final manuscript, which serves as a reference in case
there are any problems with special characters or special formatting. Our editors need to know what you expect your final manuscripts to appear in the journal.
- a copyright release form (see instructions below).

# Copyright Release Form
You'll need to submit a copyright release form in order for us to publish your work.
- please download a fillable pdf
[copyright release form](copyright/CopyrightRelease_generic_fillable.pdf).
- open the PDF in __Acrobat reader__ and select your conference name
(e.g., CCSC Eastern Conference) and journal number (e.g. 39, 3 2023) via the
dropdown menus.
- sign the form digitally as shown in [this video](https://youtu.be/ZZLM9aDT_ak).
- select the journal issue number according to the
[publication schedule](https://lubaochuan.github.io/ccsc-editor).
- please note that **both** Part I **and** Part IV need author signatures!
- the form can be signed by all authors or by the principal author for all
co-authors with their approval.
- save changes and submit the saved pdf along with your final manuscript.
