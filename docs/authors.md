# For Authors
Each regional conferenceâ€™s call for papers has its own submission guidelines
for submitting work for consideration. Usually a PDF file with the authors'
information hidden is sufficient. You may choose to follow the final manuscript
formatting guidelines, but it is completely optional.

# Final Manuscript
Once your work is accepted by the conference committee, you must prepare your
work for publication by following this guideline. We __strongly__ recommend
that you use our
[Latex templates](https://github.com/lubaochuan/ccsc-editor), which formats
your work using a predefined style. It also makes our journal editor's job
easier because the final journal editing and compilation is done in Latex.

The [Latex templates](https://github.com/lubaochuan/ccsc-editor) repository
contains further instructions in README files. You can download the repository
and choose the template you need. Each template has a sample pdf file showing
what the formatted work looks like.

If you do not want to use Latex we do accept final manuscripts in Word doc.
Please use this [template in Word doc format](samples/sample-converted.docx), which is converted from our Latex template. It has the correct margin size and font size, which should
help you gauge the size of your paper (number of pages). Here is a list of sample publishable items:
- [speech abstract](samples/speech_abstract.pdf)
- [workshop abstract](samples/workshop_abstract.pdf)
- [tutorial abstract](samples/tutorial_abstract.pdf)
- [poster abstract](samples/poster_abstract.pdf)
- [workshop abstract](samples/workshop_abstract.pdf)
- [tutorial abstract](samples/tutorial_abstract.pdf)
- [poster abstract](samples/poster_abstract.pdf)
- [panel asbstract](samples/panel.pdf)
- [lightning talk abstract](samples/lightning_talk.pdf)
- [paper](samples/paper.pdf)

The following items need to be in your final manuscript submission:
- final manuscript (paper or abstracts), which should include all Latex source
files (.tex, .bib, and image files) or the Word doc (with image files) and the
generated PDF files.
- copyright release form (see instructions below)

# Copyright Release Form
You must submit a copyright release form in order for us to publish your work.
- please download a fillable pdf
[copyright release form](copyright/CopyrightRelease_generic_fillable.pdf).
- open the PDF in __Acrobat reader__ and select your conference name
(e.g., CCSC Eastern Conference) and journal number (e.g. 34, 3 2019) via the
dropdown menus.
- sign the form digitally as shown in [this video](https://youtu.be/ZZLM9aDT_ak).
- save changes and submit the saved pdf along with your final manuscript.

Note:
- __Both__ part I and part IV (at the very end of the form) must be signed.
_ The form can be signed by all authors or by the __principal author__ for all
co-authors with their approval.
