Each regional conferenceâ€™s call for papers has its own submission guidelines
for submitting work for consideration. Usually a pdf file with the authors'
information hidden is sufficient.

# Final Manuscript
Regarding final manuscript submission for publication in the Journal of
Computing Sciences in Colleges we __strongly__ recommend that you use our
[Latex templates](https://github.com/lubaochuan/ccsc-editor), which takes care
of the formatting for you. It also makes our journal editor's job easier because
the final journal editing and compilation is done in Latex.

If you do not want to use Latex we do accept final manuscripts in Word doc.
Please format your work as much as you can according to the pdf example in the
[templates](https://github.com/lubaochuan/ccsc-editor).
Exact formatting is unnecessary because your work will be converted into Latex.

The following items need to be in your final manuscript submission:
- final manuscript (paper or abstracts), which should include all Latex source files
(.tex, .bib, and image files) or the Word doc file and the generated PDF file.
- copyright release form (see instructions as follows)

# Copyright Release From
You must submit a copyright release form in order for us to publish your work.
- please download a fillable pdf
[copyright release form](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SzmJkMTRi84isEoiTe0X1wwGZGeOWofo/view?usp=sharing).
- open the pdf in __Acrobat reader__ and select your conference name
(e.g., CCSC Eastern Conference) and journal number (e.g. 34, 3 2019) via the
dropdown menus.
- sign the form digitally as shown in [this video](https://youtu.be/ZZLM9aDT_ak).
- save changes and submit the saved pdf along with your final manuscript.

Note:
- __Both__ part I and part IV (at the very end of the form) must be signed.
_ The form can be signed by all authors or by the __principal author__ for all
co-authors with their approval.
