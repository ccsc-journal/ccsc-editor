A regional editor serves as a liaison between the regional conference committee
and the national editor. Whoever works in this capacity are responsible for
passing the following documents to the national editor before the deadline.
* draft conference program
* welcome statement from conference chair
* regional board and conference committee rosters (or make sure the rosters are
up to date on [CCSC website ](http://www.ccsc.org/regions/) or conference website)
* reviewer list
* final manuscript for all publishable items along with the copyright
release form

# Publishable Items
Here is a comprehensive list of publishable items for the journal:
* papers
* nifty assignments
* workshop abstracts
* tutorial abstracts
* poster abstracts
* panel abstracts
* speech abstracts (keynote or banquet) with speaker bios

# Import Dates
* final manuscript due date for authors (__AUTHOR_DUE__)
* __EDITOR_DUE__ is the deadline for regional editor to send all
publishable items to the national editor; it can be as late as __one
month__ before the conference date.

# Work with Authors
### Collect manuscript
After the regional committee accepts papers (and other items) for the
conference the following should happen:
* All authors should be notified with the instructions on final manuscript
formatting, the link to the current copyright release form, and the method to
submit the final manuscript to the regional editor.
* The regional editor should share a list of accepted items with the national
editor to keep track of final submissions (here is [an example](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hxodui1yzcsJGt2iDZrRXYK9hmTV9hoQ3N2pl3OQFvA/edit?usp=sharing)).

By __AUTHOR_DUE__ date the regional editor must received all the publishable
items, each of which should include:
* final version in Latex and in PDF
* a signed and dated copyright release form

## Check for errors
For paper submission, the regional editor need to collect the following:
- paper manuscript in Latex and PDF
- included figures/images in separate files
- copyright release form

We do accept final manuscript submissions in Word doc. In this case,
the regional editor either needs to reformat the submissions in Latex using
the [formatting instructions](https://github.com/lubaochuan/ccsc-editor) or
forward the submission to the national editor AS IS.

The regional editor need to check the copyright release forms are filled out
correctly:
- the current form is used.
- the conference name and that copyright date are correct.
- the form is signed after part I __AND__ at the very end (part IV).

The regional editor is not supposed to edit the content of the manuscripts
because easy typo should have been fixed and the authors should be responsible
for the meaty part.

# Work with the National Editor
The regional editor should send publishable items in their final
format to the national editor as soon as they become available. The deadline
is __EDITOR_DUE__. If an item is received after __EDITOR_DUE__ date, the item
is not guaranteed to appear in the journal.
