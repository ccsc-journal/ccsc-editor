# For Regional Editors
If you are a regional editor, please join our [Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ccsc-editors) for editing related
discussions. You can also read past discussions.

Note that we have switched to use __Latex__ for journal publication.
The instructions regarding to final manuscript formatting have changed.

A regional editor serves as a liaison between the regional conference committee
and the journal editor. Whoever works in this capacity are responsible for
passing the following documents to the journal editor before the deadline.

# Publishable Items
* welcome statement from conference chair ([example](samples/welcome.pdf), [latex source](samples/welcome.tex))
* regional board and conference committee rosters ([example](samples/committees.txt)) (and please make sure the rosters are
up to date on [CCSC website ](http://www.ccsc.org/regions/) or conference website)
* reviewer list ([example](samples/reviewers.txt))
* papers ([example](samples/paper.pdf))
* nifty assignments ([example](samples/nifty.pdf))
* abstracts ([workshops](samples/workshop_abstract.pdf),
  [tutorials](samples/tutorial_abstract.pdf),
  [posters](samples/poster_abstract.pdf), [panels](samples/panel.pdf), [lightning talks](samples/lightning_talk.pdf), ...)
* invited talk abstracts (e.g. keynote, banquet speech, ...) with speaker bio
  [example](samples/speech_abstract.pdf))

The Latex templates for papers and other abstracts can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/lubaochuan/ccsc-editor).

# Important Dates
There are two important dates for journal publication:
- __EDITOR_DUE__ is the deadline for a regional editor to send all
publishable items to the journal editor. Please confirm this deadline date with
the journal editor.
- __AUTHOR_DUE__ is the deadline for authors to send their finished manuscript
and copyright release form to the regional editor. Usually, a regional editor
set this date with input from the conference committee. It is recommended that
you set this date at least __one week__ before __EDITOR_DUE__ so that you have time
interact with the authors to address issues in final manuscript submissions.

# Work with Authors
## Collect manuscript
After the regional committee accepts papers (and other items) for the
conference the following should happen:
* All authors should be notified with the instructions on final manuscript
formatting, the link to the current copyright release form, and the method to
submit the final manuscript to the regional editor.
* The regional editor should share a list of accepted items with the journal
editor to keep track of final submissions (here is
[an example](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hxodui1yzcsJGt2iDZrRXYK9hmTV9hoQ3N2pl3OQFvA/edit?usp=sharing)).

By __AUTHOR_DUE__ date the regional editor must received all the publishable
items.

## Check for errors
For each publishable item the regional editor need to collect the following:
- final manuscript in Latex or in Word and the PDF showing the desired look
- included figures/images in separate files
- copyright release form

We do accept final manuscript submissions in Word doc. In this case,
the regional editor either needs to reformat the submissions in Latex using
the [formatting instructions](https://github.com/lubaochuan/ccsc-editor) or
forward the submission to the journal editor AS IS.

The regional editor need to check the copyright release forms are filled out
correctly:
- the current form is used.
- the conference name and that copyright date are correct.
- the form is signed after part I __AND__ at the very end (part IV).

The regional editor is not supposed to edit the content of the manuscripts
because easy typo should have been fixed and the authors should be responsible
for the content.

Note that When you convert a paper from Word doc to Latex, you can use
[Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) to look up each bibliography entry and copy the
`bibtex` export (by clicking the quotation mark icon). This way you don't have
to create the entries from scratch (some editing may be necessary if the entry
seems incomplete).

# Work with the Journal Editor
A regional editor should send publishable items in their final
format to the journal editor as soon as they become available. The deadline
is __EDITOR_DUE__. If an item is received after __EDITOR_DUE__ date, the item
is not guaranteed to appear in the journal.

For each publishable item the regional editor need to __email__ the journal
editor a zip file with the following:
- Latex source files for final manuscript or the Word doc
- a PDF showing the desired look of the publishable item
- included figures/images in separate files
- copyright release form

# CCSC Conflict of Interest
As best practice, CCSC holds its authors and editors to the ACM Conflict of Interest policies. These polices can be found at: [https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/conflict-of-interest](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/conflict-of-interest)
