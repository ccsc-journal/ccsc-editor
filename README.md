There are three ways to format your work.

# Use Overleaf 2.0
1. Go to https://v2.overleaf.com/ and setup an account for free.
2. Go to [https://github.com/lubaochuan/ccsc-editor/blob/master/paper_template.zip](https://github.com/lubaochuan/ccsc-editor/blob/master/paper_template.zip) and click on "download" to get `paper_template.zip` for papers, or go to [https://github.com/lubaochuan/ccsc-editor/blob/master/other_template.zip](https://github.com/lubaochuan/ccsc-editor/blob/master/other_template.zip) and click on "download" to get `other_template.zip` for other publication types (various abstracts).
3. Select "New Project" on Overleaf, choose to "Upload Project" and upload the zip file you just downloaded.
4. Click on the "Menu" on the upper left of your Overleaf project, and be sure that "TeX Live version" is set to "2020".
5. After the zip file is uploaded and expanded, you can edit the source files and click on "Recompile" to see the PDF version of your work in the browser.

6. Watch this [demo video](https://youtu.be/VYTnWlYFre8) on how to create a project on overleaf with a .zip file.

Another way to use Overleaf is to click on the following shared Overleaf projects and make a copy of your own.

* click [template project for papers](https://www.overleaf.com/read/nhkychfsbwrp)(shared Overleaf project) and make a copy.
* click [template project for other publication types](https://www.overleaf.com/read/vpczmdzyzhsv)(shared Overleaf project) and make a copy.
* watch this [demo video](https://youtu.be/9IouPnPpCuQ) on how to copy a shared project on overleaf.

# Use your own Latex
1. Go to https://github.com/lubaochuan/ccsc-editor and download a zip file or clone the repository.
2. Open the source files with your software and compile them as usual.

# Use MS Word
Word docs are acceptable if you do not want to use Latex. Please format your work using the PDF samples as examples ([paper](https://github.com/lubaochuan/ccsc-editor/blob/master/paper_template/sample.pdf), [abstract](https://github.com/lubaochuan/ccsc-editor/blob/master/other_template/sample.pdf)). Exact formatting is unnecessary because Word docs will be reformatted into Latex.
